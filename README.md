Gen AI patterns : https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/
    
    If I were to transition from Data Science to AI/ML engineering all over again in 2025, here is what I'd learn first: 
https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/use_cases/agents/

learn Software Engineering fundamentals
â€“ master git for tracking code and model changes
â€“ learn CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- master Python, async/await, and OOP
â€“ practice writing clean, maintainable Python code, follow PEP8

learn API development
â€“ try out building with FastAPI or Flask frameworks
â€“ understand http/https
â€“ learn rest APIs for model endpoints
â€“ grasp API authentication and rate limiting

learn data infrastructure
â€“ understand vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
â€“ practice storing, indexing, and querying unstructured data.
â€“ build data pipelines and ETL processes
â€“ learn about data streaming for real-time AI

learn cloud platforms
â€“ master aws/gcp/azure ML/AI services
â€“ understand docker, kubernetes 
â€“ learn serverless deployment options
â€“ implement cloud-based monitoring

study MLops fundamentals
â€“ implement model monitoring and logging
â€“ master model versioning and registry
â€“ understand A/B testing in production
â€“ understand system monitoring and alerting

learn production best practices
â€“ implement proper error handling
- understand time/space complexity (Big O notation)
â€“ master debugging in production environments
â€“ master common AI system design patterns (prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestration, and evaluation) 

If tomorrow I were hit by a bus, got a concussion, and lost all of my memory. 
I would be SAD, but I'd still want to learn ML engineering from scratch. And here is how I would do it in 2024, mostly in order:

Learn math:
 - linear algebra: Matrices, vectors, linear equations and transformations, 
 - probability and statistics: Distributions, hypothesis testing, Bias-Variance Tradeoff, and conditional probability.
 - calculus: Derivatives, integrals, gradient descent.

Learn Python:
 - data structures: Lists, arrays, and dictionaries.
 - libraries: NumPy, Pandas for data manipulations, scikit-learn for ml and Matplotlib for data viz. 
 - code organization and control flow: Functions, loops, and conditionals. 

Data Preprocessing:
 - learn how to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
 - read on feature engineering 
 - try out data normalization and scaling

Core ML Algorithms:
 - Supervised Learning: Linear and Logistic Regression, and Classification algorithms(K-NN, Decision Trees, SVM)
 - Unsupervised Learning: Clustering (K-means) and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA)
 - Reinforcement Learning: Basics of agents, environments, and reward systems

Model Evaluation and Validation:
 - learn metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
 - cross-validation techniques
 - learn about overfitting and underfitting, and how to address them

Get Hands-On Experience with Deployment:
 - use datasets from Kaggle and/or models from Huggingface. 
- learn to deploy with Flask, FastAPI, and on Cloud (AWS or Azure or GCP)
 - participate in ml competitions or workshops. 

Digest everything before diving into advanced topics like:
 - ml frameworks like PyTorch, and TensorFlow 
 - neural networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks
 - understand (NLP) and computer vision (CV) applications and ensemble techniques 

Focus on these first: 

ðŸ”‘ Understand Neural Networks
LLMs are built on neural networks, so getting a handle on the basics like layers, activation functions, and backpropagation will take you further than focusing on the latest AI fad.
Start here: Neural Networks and Deep Learning - https://lnkd.in/gsPi-nSj

ðŸ”‘ Prompt Engineering Basics
LLMs are only as good as the prompts they receive. Learning the fundamentals of crafting effective prompts can help you get better results from any AI coding assistant or LLM tool.
Start here: Prompt Engineering Guide - https://lnkd.in/gtVtw5nU

ðŸ”‘ Data Curation & Preparation
LLMs need vast amounts of data to perform well. Understanding how to clean, preprocess, and organize data will always be a high-demand skill in this space.
Start here: Training & Fine-Tuning: Data -https://lnkd.in/gmMApezn

ðŸ”‘ NLP & LLM Fundamentals
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the heart of LLMs. Get familiar with concepts like tokenization, embeddings, and attention mechanisms to understand what drives LLM performance.
Start here: Andrej Karpathyâ€™s Zero to Hero playlist - https://lnkd.in/gQuHDJup

ðŸ”‘ Model Deployment & Scaling
Knowing how to deploy, fine-tune, and monitor LLMs in production is just as important as building them. Cloud infrastructure and APIs will be your best friends here.
