Understand HTTP/HTTPS protocols
Learn REST APIs for model endpoints
Grasp API authentication and rate limiting

3. Data Infrastructure

Understand vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
Practice storing, indexing, and querying unstructured data
Build data pipelines and ETL processes
Learn about data streaming for real-time AI

4. Cloud Platforms

Master AWS/GCP/Azure ML/AI services
Understand Docker and Kubernetes
Learn serverless deployment options
Implement cloud-based monitoring

5. MLOps Fundamentals

Implement model monitoring and logging
Master model versioning and registry
